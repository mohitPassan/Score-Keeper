# Score-Keeper
Basic score keeper for two players.

Here is a very simple and basic app (I don't know what to call it) which keeps score of two players.
The heading shows the score of 'player one' to 'player two'.
Below it is the score needed to win.
There's an input that decides the winning score.
Then comes three buttons-Player One, increases player one's score
                         Player Two, increases player two's score
                         Reset, resets the score.
